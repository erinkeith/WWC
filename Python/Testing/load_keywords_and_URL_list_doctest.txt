keywords.txt

technology
awesome

>>> loadSourceList('notafile.txt') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  ...
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ...

if the file is empty, the error should be handled
>>> loadSourceList('empty.txt')
['']

if the file is not in the proper format, the error should be handled
>>> loadSourceList('wrongfile.csv')
['women technology awesome']

verify output
>>> loadSourceList('keywords.txt')
['women', 'technology', 'awesome']
